Converts file bytes into a fixed 32√ó32 representation.

Uses a trained Random Forest classifier (malimg_binary_rf_model.pkl).

Produces a malware probability score.

If malware is detected, file is automatically moved to the quarantine/ folder.

Keeps the system safe while preserving suspicious files.

Each scan prints probability score + decision (BENIGN / MALWARE).
